# From a VR engine to a 3D display: the formula

A game with a VR mode already renders two eyes. A 3D television, projector or
monitor can show those two eyes directly, side by side or top and bottom,
with no headset. What stands in the way is everything the VR mode does *for a
headset*: head tracking, lens distortion, a floating HUD panel, a cursor in a
virtual screen. This file lists what has to change, learned by doing it on
Half-Life 2 (2026-09-24, `sourcevr/`), whose own VR interface
(`ISourceVirtualReality`) made it a good teacher: the structure below is what
most VR games share.

wiz3D solves a different problem, stereo for games that never had a VR mode
(a DirectX proxy that renders each draw twice). This formula is for games
that already have one.

## 1. The eyes: a window, not a headset

- **Projection.** Each eye gets an off-axis frustum: the two frustums share
  one window at the convergence distance (zero parallax, the screen plane),
  and each eye sits half the separation to its side. A headset's projection
  is symmetric per eye and centred on its lens; a display needs the shared
  window, or everything floats in front of the screen.
- **Field of view** comes from the game (its 2D setting), widened to the
  displayed aspect the way the game does it for widescreen, not from a lens.
- **Defaults that looked right on a 46-inch set:** separation 2.5 game units
  (about 64 mm in Source), screen plane at 120 units.
- **Packing:** each eye into its half of the frame (left eye first, as HDMI
  1.4 packs it), the display told by its own 3D mode or by the signal.

## 2. The view: the game drives it, not a head

- Turn head tracking off and let the view follow the game: the mouse in
  play, the recorded angles in a demo. Half-Life 2 has the mode built in
  (`vr_moveaim_mode 7`, "HMD orientation is completely ignored"); its
  default left the view fixed while the demo's player looked around.
- Aim equals view. Anything that separates them (a cursor that moves
  inside the HUD, a torso that turns separately) is for a headset.

## 3. Composition: eyes into targets, targets into the frame

- Render each eye into its own target and copy it into its half of the
  frame. Rendering straight into the halves of the frame worked for the
  scene, but the HUD and the loading screen had nowhere to go.
- Lens distortion is replaced by that copy: nothing to undistort.
- **Engine-specific:** Half-Life 2 never asked the module to create its
  targets (it only does when VR is set up in its video settings at start),
  so the module creates them on first use, inside the engine's
  render-target allocation. A material used for the first time from the
  engine's render thread without a precache drew as the error texture (the
  purple-black checkerboard); precaching once fixed it.

## 4. The 2D layer: HUD and menus on the screen plane

- A VR mode paints the HUD into a small sheet (640x480 in Half-Life 2) and
  shows it as a panel floating in the world, sized for a headset. On a
  display, paste that sheet across the whole screen, **identical in both
  eyes**: zero parallax, so it sits exactly on the screen plane, where a
  flat HUD belongs.
- Rearrange for 3D where the 2D layout gets in the way: Half-Life 2's ammo
  panel sits over the gun, confusing in depth; its row moved to the top,
  the rest of the sheet shifted down whole (swapping bands cut the weapon
  selection in two). Messages that fade in and out stay where the game
  puts them.
- **Menus keep the game's layout.** Moving parts of the sheet while a menu
  is open moved its buttons away from where the cursor clicks. The engine
  tells the module when the cursor is visible.

## 5. The crosshair: 2D, centred, identical in both eyes

- A VR mode aims the crosshair through the weapon and projects it into the
  view. Half-Life 2 does that for a 640x480 screen and paints it into each
  eye unscaled, so at full eye resolution it lands off-centre.
- Two answers, both kept as modes: render each eye at the size the VR HUD
  assumes (the engine's own crosshair lands centred; the picture is softer,
  fine for low-resolution textures), or turn the engine's crosshair off and
  draw the game's own crosshair art on the 2D layer, once per eye, at the
  centre (sharp; for high-resolution textures).
- Use art that blends by its **alpha**. An additive crosshair (colour added
  to what is behind it) looks different in each eye, because the two eyes
  see different backgrounds; drawn into the transparent HUD sheet it became
  a black square.

## 6. The weapon and its effects

- Draw the first-person weapon model, not the third-person one a headset
  mode prefers (Valve's own Half-Life 2 VR setting).
- Effects placed by converting between the weapon's field of view and the
  world's (the muzzle flash sprite in Source) miss the gun once the weapon
  is drawn with the eye projection. Making the two fields of view agree
  puts them back (`viewmodel_fov 90` in Half-Life 2; a cheat-protected
  setting today).

## 7. Input: one window, two eyes

- The system pointer moves across the whole window, both eyes, while the
  game's UI is one sheet shown in each eye. Find how the game maps the
  pointer onto its UI (log both: in Half-Life 2 the UI cursor is window
  pixels 1:1, and the sheet is the window's top-left 640x480) and confine
  the pointer to the part of the window the sheet shows.

## 8. Settings: apply on entry, restore on exit

- The per-game VR settings belong to the moment VR starts (Half-Life 2
  meant to run `cfg/sourcevr_<game>.cfg`, and this build does not). Settings
  that also affect 2D play (the crosshair) must be restored when VR stops,
  and on the next start if the game quit while in VR.

## 9. What stayed the same

Shadows, lighting, level transitions, saves and loads needed nothing: the
engine renders each eye itself, so everything it renders is right in both.
That is the advantage of a VR engine over a stereo proxy, and why this
formula starts from one.
