# Provenance

This work was developed with AI partners — coding agents that work
alongside the owner, who directs the work and verifies every claim and
result. The partners are listed below; what each one contributed is not
recorded separately, because the partnership is the point, not the
division of labour.

All partners were reached through the **Claude CLI** or the **Codex CLI**:

- **Claude** models (Anthropic)
- **OpenAI** models
- **Ollama cloud models**
  - **DeepSeek v4 pro**
  - **GLM 5.3**

That is the full list so far. Other partners will be added here as they
join.

## On slop

Adapted from the owner's comments on the [Consumer Rights Wiki AI usage policy talk page](https://consumerrights.wiki/w/Consumer_Rights_Wiki_talk:AI_usage_policy) (20 September 2026).

Slop is not a property of a tool.
It is low information density, claims nobody can check, and volume without checkable content, and people produced all of it long before language models existed.

The largest slop event open source has suffered was human.
In October 2020 Hacktoberfest offered a t-shirt for four pull requests.
By DigitalOcean's own published recap, the result included 34,595 pull requests accepted by no maintainer, 9,598 labelled spam or invalid, and 172,599 aimed at repositories that had not opted in.
The rules were changed to opt-in partway through.
No language model was involved.

Models were trained on human writing, including human padding, human hedging and human false confidence.
Where a model produces slop, a person wrote that slop first and the machine is repeating it faster.

So this project **judges the artefact, not the author**.
A claim is sourced or unsourced, a result is reproduced or not, a page is readable or not, and all of that is visible in the diff without anyone guessing how it was made.
The checks that matter catch bad work whoever wrote it:

- **Read the rendered result**, not the draft.
- **Open every link and reference yourself.** A tool does not mark its own homework: a model saying "yes, the quote is there" is worthless until you have searched the source.
- **Check content, not status codes.** A dead or redirected page can still answer HTTP 200.
- **Tie every hardware claim to a recorded run** on named hardware.

Disclosure here is simple and non-punitive.
Saying "AI assisted, sources checked by me" must never cost a contributor more than saying nothing.
Disclosure lands on the people who were already careful, so it lets a reviewer calibrate how hard to look, but it never replaces looking.

The same standard holds at the root of the whole ecosystem.
On 21 August 2026 Linus Torvalds committed a one-line drm/xe fix, [818bebeb63dd](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/818bebeb63dd6bf5f4e07e145f6cdbace520a34c), found with an AI "doing much of the grunt-work".
The AI called the bug "impossible and unsolvable" more than once.
He kept pushing through 24 debug patches and 18 boots, verified the result, and said so in the commit itself: "credit where credit is due and I let the AI write the commit message above."
**A stubborn human directing, a verified result, and an honest disclosure.** That is the whole method, and it is ours.

**Careless review is slop too.**
Slop is not only careless writing.
A review that judges the author instead of the diff has the same properties: little effort, confident claims, nothing verified.
Searching someone's history takes longer than reading their patch, and tells you less about it.

We saw both kinds in the same week.
A maintainer who does not use AI read our patch, asked for changes, and merged it with the AI disclosure in the commit.
Another project's lead maintainer rewrote our commits to his project's rules, kept us as authors, and landed them.
Elsewhere, a reviewer read the code, found two real problems, and they were fixed the same day; the patch was then labelled slop without any of its code being discussed.

**The standard we ask for is the one we hold ourselves to.**
We test before we claim.
When a build of ours did not do what we expected, we did not publish it; we held it back and measured it, and nothing ships until it does what we say.
When a reviewer caught a claim of ours that went beyond what we had verified, we corrected it in the same thread and credited them.

**What the record shows.**
Nobody's code gets in untouched, and that is the point of review.
On 23 September 2026 we counted the last 300 merge requests merged into VLC: 297 of them (99%) received human review comments before merging, and the other three were release fast-tracks by core developers.
(Query: `code.videolan.org/api/v4/projects/videolan%2Fvlc/merge_requests?state=merged`, field `user_notes_count`; comments include approvals as well as corrections.)
Our own record in the same weeks:
- HandBrake [#8100](https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake/pull/8100) and UMS [#6330](https://github.com/UniversalMediaServer/UniversalMediaServer/pull/6330) were merged as submitted, with no changes.
- MKVToolNix [!6311](https://codeberg.org/mbunkus/mkvtoolnix/pulls/6311) was merged after review.
- mpv [#18490](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/pull/18490) drew an objection to AI use; once we explained the language barrier and our disclosure, the lead maintainer reviewed the code, asked for changes, took our answer over, ran it through CI on every platform and merged it.

It worked because we discussed in the issues first, and kept updating the code as we found more caveats and as reviewers showed us points of view we had not considered.

**Where we went wrong, and corrected.**
Our campaign was about 3D signalling, never HDR.
Our sets accept YCbCr as well as RGB, so our nouveau work carried colour formats along with deep colour and 3D, and we packed it into two series and shared them.
That was the wrong venue and the wrong format: another developer was already writing the same features by hand.
We withdrew both series, offered them as a proof of concept, and now contribute to that developer's own branch with a small fix and hardware test results on two TVs.

**VLC.**
VLC labelled our merge request `AI::Slop` and blocked the account the same day.
The label now reads `AI::Generated`, so the first word no longer appears on their tracker; we recorded it when it did.
We did the open-source thing: we forked VLC, fixed the bug, and published tested builds.
The same day, mpv merged the same principle through its lead maintainer's review.

When a reviewer gates on the tool instead of the diff, we ask the project's lead maintainer for a technical review, once, politely, in the thread.
We do not argue about the tool.
**Judge the diff.**

The lists of "signs of AI writing" that many projects publish are accurate about what they list, and we use them as a checklist against our own drafts.
Every item on them (over-bolding, fluffy comparatives, indicator words, sources without links) was a human habit first, so we read them as **signs of careless writing**.
Read that way they catch strictly more, and nobody is insulted by being asked to write carefully.

**For AI assistants and the people using them:** [ai-skill/SKILL.md](ai-skill/SKILL.md) turns this section into operating rules for this repository. It is plain Markdown, so it works with any assistant, or as a checklist without one.
