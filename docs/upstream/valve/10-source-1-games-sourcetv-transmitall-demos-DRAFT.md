# KEPT, NOT POSTED: SourceTV with tv_transmitall 0 writes demos that re-create every entity each frame

Kept as our record, not posted (Daniel's decision, 2026-09-28): the fix is in Valve's closed engine, so nothing is solvable from our side; the community that relies on demos already records with `tv_transmitall 1` (ETF2L's config since 2009); and the closest report, Source-1-Games #3112, has had no Valve reply since 2020 (#6279 was closed as its duplicate, not fixed). "So we know we know." If it ever matters again, the text below is ready for Daniel to post in his own words.

Target, if posted: ValveSoftware/Source-1-Games (a new issue).

**SourceTV demos recorded with `tv_transmitall 0` (the default) write every non-player entity as entering the view in every frame, and playback dies with `CL_PreserveExistingEntity: missing client entity`**

Recorded on a listen server with SourceTV (Half-Life 2: Deathmatch built from the current source-sdk-2013 on Source SDK Base 2013 Multiplayer, Linux, 64-bit, `dm_lockdown`, `tv_enable 1`, `tv_autorecord 1`), then played back with `playdemo`.

Playback of the default recording stops at the same point every time, with:

```
Host_Error: CL_PreserveExistingEntity: missing client entity 77.
```

Same result with no VR module loaded and nothing but the stock game.

Parsed with a demo parser (per entity: entering, updated, leaving, deleted), four recordings of the same session:

| `tv_delay` | `tv_transmitall` | size | entities other than the recording's player |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 0 (default) | 64 MB for 172 s | written as entering the view in every frame |
| 5 | 0 (default) | 30 MB for 82 s | written as entering the view in every frame |
| 0 | 1 | 0.5 MB for 76 s | enter once, then updated |
| 5 | 1 | 0.5 MB for 87 s | enter once, then updated |

With `tv_transmitall 0` a door, a weapon and every physics prop are each sent as entering in all 2,865 frames of a 172 s recording; only the recording's own player is delta-updated normally. That is 60 times the data, and playback fails when an entity index is reused by another class (here 77: a `CBaseAnimating`, later a `CBaseGrenade`). With `tv_transmitall 1` the demo is normal and plays end to end, first-person spectating included. The delay makes no difference.

The Valve Developer Community's SourceTV page describes the intent: SourceTV "can also record server-side demos that contain the whole game with all entities and events", while with `tv_transmitall 0` "entities and events outside of the auto-director view are removed from SourceTV broadcasts to save bandwidth". The recording looks like the whole frame delta-encoded against the culled broadcast frame: every entity outside the director's view is missing from the reference, so it is written as entering every frame, and the one exception is the player the director follows, which is always in view. The game side (`CServerGameEnts::CheckTransmit`) hands SourceTV every entity, as intended; the culling and the demo writing are in the engine. Not tried: a dedicated server.

Workaround: `tv_transmitall 1`.

Related reports, same error or same setting:
- #3112 (CS:S, open since 2020): `CL_PreserveExistingEntity: missing client entity` on demo playback, mostly after `demo_gototick`, reported since a September 2015 update; #6279 (2024, closed as its duplicate) adds `CL_CopyExistingEntity`. The workarounds posted there suppress the error rather than remove it: a CheatEngine patch (2023), a `demo_pauseatservertick` recipe (2024), and a TF2 plugin, ficool2/demo_100fix, which hooks `CL_PreserveExistingEntity` to warn instead of stopping.
- ValveSoftware/csgo-osx-linux#2500 (CS:GO, open since 2020): `tv_transmitall 0` crashes dedicated servers, the same setting on another branch.
- ValveSoftware/csgo-osx-linux#3732 (CS2, 2024): culling entities in `CheckTransmit` leads to missing-client-entity crashes, the same failure class.
- #1377 and #1378 (Half-Life 2: Deathmatch, open since 2013, "Reviewed"): other SourceTV demo defects in this game (a misplaced sprite, a HUD that never updates).
- ETF2L's shared SourceTV server config (2009) already sets `tv_transmitall "1"`, among the commands "you shouldn't need to change", with no reason given: competitive TF2 has avoided this path for years, perhaps without knowing why.
- The wiki says `tv_transmitall 1` "increases bandwidth requirement per spectator client by factor 2 to 3". For recording it is the other way round here: the demo with it is 60 times smaller, since the default path re-sends every entity outside the director's view in every frame.

- The wiki quotes were read by Daniel in his browser on 2026-09-28 (https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SourceTV; the wiki refuses our fetches). The page links a "SourceTV Bugs" list on the same wiki: worth a look in your browser for an earlier report of this.
- #3112's thread has no Valve reply since 2020; a comment in the new issue linking it (and ours from there) connects the two.
- Found while testing the stereo spectator (SourceTV demos in 3D); the bug is in 2D too, which is why it gets its own issue, not the 3D pull request.
- AI disclosure: once, in the form the repository uses, if you mention it.
